Hello, I'm Ziquan, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my homepage. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Professor [Yunjun Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoyj_cn). Throughout my academic journey, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors, including Professor [Lu Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/luchen) at Zhejiang University, Professor [Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/?page_id=37) at Aalborg University in Denmark, and Professor [Baihua Zheng](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/bhzheng/) at Singapore Management University.

My primary research interests revolve around spatio-temporal databases, with a focus on areas such as big trajectory management and analytics, distributed processing, spatio-temporal data intelligence, and intelligent traffic systems. I have contributed to the academic community by co-/authoring more than 20 CCF-A papers, which have been published in top-tier international conferences and journals in the fields of database and data mining such as VLDBJ, TKDE, SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, and KDD. During the past three years, I have been honored with several awards, including the Outstanding Ph.D. Graduates from Zhejiang Province in 2023, the National Scholarship in 2021 and 2022, the Most Academic Value Award at the Zhejiang University Doctoral Innovation Forum in 2022, and the World Champion of KDD Cup 2022 (more than 2,000 participating teams). Additionally, I'm proud to mention that some of my research outputs have been integrated into the products of well-known companies such as Alibaba, Huawei, and Hikvision.

On this homepage, you will find more information about my research accomplishments, publications, and the impact of my work. If you have any inquiries, collaboration opportunities, or would simply like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me. I am going to join the [School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/) as a Researcher under the esteemed "Hundred Talents Plan" (百人计划研究员).

I'm excited to engage in meaningful discussions and contribute to further advancements in the field of spatio-temporal databases.

Thank you for visiting my homepage, and I look forward to connecting with you!
