Hello, I'm Ziquan, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my homepage. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University in 2023, under the guidance of Professor [Yunjun Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoyj_cn). Throughout my academic journey, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors, including Prof. [Lu Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/luchen) at Zhejiang University, Prof. [Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/?page_id=37) at Aalborg University, and Prof. [Baihua Zheng](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/bhzheng/) at Singapore Management University. I am going to join the **School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University** in 2023 as a Researcher titled by "Hundred Talents Plan" (百人计划研究员).

My primary research interests revolve around **spatio-temporal databases**, with a focus on areas such as big trajectory management and analytics, distributed processing, spatio-temporal data intelligence, and intelligent traffic systems. I have contributed to the academic community by co-/authoring more than 10 CCF-A papers, which have been published in top-tier international conferences and journals in the fields of database and data mining such as VLDBJ, TKDE, SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, and KDD. I am serving as an AE of IEEE TKDE, IEEE TPDS, and Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ). Meanwhile, I am the regular AC of NeurIPS, ICML, and IJCAI. Additionally, I'm proud to mention that some of my research outputs have been integrated into the products of well-known companies such as Alibaba, Huawei, and Hikvision.

<!-- During the past three years, I have been honored with several awards, including the Outstanding Ph.D. Graduates from Zhejiang Province in 2023, the National Scholarship in 2021 and 2022, the Most Academic Value Award at the Zhejiang University Doctoral Innovation Forum in 2022, and the World Champion of KDD Cup 2022 (more than 2,000 participating teams). Additionally, I'm proud to mention that some of my research outputs have been integrated into the products of well-known companies such as Alibaba, Huawei, and Hikvision. -->
